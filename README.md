# Zomboid Zone Resetter

The [Good Old Dayz](http://www.thegoodolddayz.com/) zomboid server has a [really awesome mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679542152) that implies certain areas of the map will reset periodically. However, this mod does not include that functionality. Here is a java app that takes the necessary actions to reset those specific zones.
